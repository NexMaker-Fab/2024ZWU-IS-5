        <h2>Wear personal protective equipment:<br>
            Operators must wear appropriate personal protective equipment, such as laser safety glasses or face shields, to ensure that their eyes and skin are not damaged by laser radiation.</h2>
        <h2>Corresponding wavelength: 1064/405nm</h2>
            <img src="image/CNC1.jpg" width="600">
        <h2>Equipment maintenance and calibration:<br>
            Ensure that laser cutting equipment is regularly maintained and calibrated to ensure that it operates within safe parameter ranges.</h2>
            <img src="image/011.jpg" width="600">
        <h2>Work Area Restrictions:<br>
            Use safety barriers or other appropriate facilities to restrict unauthorized personnel from entering the work area and prevent unintentional exposure to laser radiation.</h2>

          <br><h1>Stainless Steel</h1>
          <img src="image/CNC6.jpg" width="600">
          <h2>The advantages of stainless steel as a laser cutting material:</h2><br>
          <h2>1.High precision<br>
              Laser cutting of stainless steel pipes is a high-precision processing method, with an accuracy of less than 0.1mm. This high-precision machining can not only meet the high precision requirements of component processing in industrial production, but also meet the needs of art, model making and other fields.</h2>
          <h2>2.High efficiency<br>
              Compared to traditional processing methods, laser cutting of stainless steel pipes has higher processing efficiency. On the one hand, laser cutting equipment is easy to operate and can complete complex shape cutting in a short time; On the other hand, the power density of lasers is high, and high-power lasers can be used to cut stainless steel pipes of different thicknesses, greatly shortening the processing cycle and improving production efficiency.</h2>
          <h2>3.Security<br>
              In the process of laser cutting, there is no need to fix the material, and there are no issues such as vibration and noise, avoiding safety hazards caused by vibration or noise in traditional processing.</h2>
          <br><h2>Brands suitable for laser cutting</h2>
          <br><h2>1. # 304 grade stainless steel<br>
                  2. # 201 grade stainless steel<br>
                  3. # Q235 grade stainless steel<br>
                  4. # Q345 grade stainless steel<br></h2>
          <br><h1>Leatherwear</h1>
          <img src="image/CNC7.JPG" width="600">
          <h2>The advantages of laser cutting leather</h2>
          <br><h2>1. High precision:<br>
              The laser beam is small and energy intensive, which can achieve very fine cutting. The cutting edge is flat and smooth, and there is no need for subsequent polishing treatment.<br>
              <br>2. No damage:<br>
              Laser cutting does not require direct contact with materials, nor does it generate vibration and impact during the cutting process, so it will not cause any damage to leather materials.<br>
              <br>3. Efficiency:<br>
              Laser cutting has a fast speed, high degree of automation in the entire cutting process, and does not require manual intervention, thus greatly improving production efficiency.<br></h2>
          <br><h2>It should be noted that laser cutting of leather can sometimes result in burnt marks at the edges</h2>
