        <h2>3D printing technology has broken through the limitations of traditional manufacturing and provided designers with unlimited design space. Traditional manufacturing methods, such as wooden lathes, rolling mills, and molding machines, are limited by their tools and processes and can only manufacture products of specific shapes. However, 3D printers are not limited by these limitations and can manufacture complex geometric shapes that are difficult or even impossible to process with traditional techniques. Its working principle is to decompose objects into layers of 2D areas for printing, so it can process any complex object, and its accuracy depends on the minimum material particles that the printer can output. This technology brings enormous possibilities for geometric design and optimization</h2>
        <br><h2>For example: Fiber optic connectors</h2>

        <br><h1>New 3D technologies and prospects</h1><br>
        <h2>Associate Professor Zhang Hao from the Department of Chemistry at Tsinghua University, Academician Li Jinghong, Associate Professor Lin Linhan from the Department of Precision Instruments, and Professor Sun Hongbo have jointly developed a universal 3D printing method for nanomaterials, abbreviated as 3D Pin. By introducing photosensitive nitrogen-containing small molecules, a variety of inorganic nanomaterials (semiconductor, metal, oxide nanomaterials) have been printed at the nanoscale. The structure has a high proportion of inorganic components and excellent mechanical and tunable optical properties. The relevant research results were published in Science with the title "3D printing of inorganic nanomaterials by photochemically bonding collisional nanocrystals"</h2>
