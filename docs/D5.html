        <h1>Design our first 3D model</h1>
        1.<br>
        Based on the final design, we need a 3D printed shell and suitable connecting parts to connect it to the faucet.<br>
        Firstly, we drew basic sketches of two components<br>
        <img src="image/CAD1.JPG" width="1000"><br>
        2.<br>
        Sketches include front and top views<br>
        <img src="image/CAD2.JPG" width="1000"><br>
        3.<br>
        Due to the software version, we used SW instead of CAD, which is more concise and efficient<br>
        <div class="video-container">
            <video controls>
              <source src="image/SW1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
              Your browser does not support the video tag.
            </video>
          </div>
          4.<br>
          This time, the components are bolts, which are used to connect our design with the faucet<br>
          <img src="image/CAD3.JPG" width="1000"><br>
          5.<br>
          And the various data of the bolts have also been discussed and discussed, and we hope to select the best and most suitable bolts<br>

            </video>
          </div>
          6.<br>
          In short, this is what we expect this component to do<br>

        <h1>Automated Modeling</h1>
        About Automated Modeling of Solidworks<br>
        Using SolidWorks API: API stands for Application Programming Interface. <br>
        Through programming, you can automate many features of SolidWorks,<br>
         including creating, modifying, and analyzing models. SolidWorks API supports multiple programming languages,<br>
          including VBA and VB NET, C #, and C++<br>
