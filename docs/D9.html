        <br><h2>Project Overview:</h2>
        <h2>The core of smart agriculture lies in smart management, which requires a complete architecture to support. Tuobao Technology's "DTU+LoRa gateway+IoT platform" is based on the LoRa technology suite, providing end-to-end LoRaWAN solutions that can quickly upgrade traditional industry applications to LoRa wireless Internet of Things applications, achieving "smart" management of the agricultural industry.
            The LoRa terminal has extremely low power consumption, with a battery that can last for 3-5 years. Under the same conditions, it requires fewer gateways and does not require wiring, resulting in low construction costs. At the same time, it also supports a variety of application access. Its application in the agricultural industry can provide farmers with a low-power, highly reliable, large-scale deployment, and affordable industrial grade Internet of Things system, which saves water and effort, and brings maximum benefits to agricultural practitioners</h2>
        <br><h2>Related Technologies:</h2>
        <H2>DTU:<br>
            DTU is a wireless data transmission terminal based on LoRa technology, which utilizes LoRa networks to provide users with wireless data transmission capabilities. DTU uses an embedded real-time operating system as its software support platform and provides RS232 and RS485 interfaces, which can directly connect to serial devices and achieve transparent data transmission function; Low power design, capable of achieving digital input and output, analog input, pulse counting and other functions, can quickly help integrators and developers achieve sensing data collection in various occasions</H2>
        <h2>IOT platform:<br>
            responsible for environmental management, security monitoring, environmental monitoring, and a series of environmental control contents</h2>
